  "wiki_summary": "\"Nightrain\" is a song written by the American rock band Guns N' Roses in the mid 1980s. It is the third song on the band's 1987 debut album, Appetite for Destruction. \n\nAlthough it was released as a single, the song was not included in their best-of album. It reached #93 on the US Billboard charts.\n\nThe song is a tribute to an infamous brand of cheap Californian wine, Night Train Express, which was extremely popular with the band during their early days because of its low price and high alcohol content. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Guns+N%27+Roses/_/Nightrain\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

Albarn therefore wrote this song, which became the lead off single in April 1993. This song has often been cited as the birth of Britpop, as Blur adopted a very British sound and image following a disastrous second tour of America in 1992. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Blur/_/For+Tomorrow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

The video is a live performance recorded at Alexandra Palace.\n\nThe lyrics seem to emphasise the (then) up-coming millennium change and the fact that people contemplate the future rather than take care of the present. The line from the song is \"End of a Century / It's nothing special\".\n\nDamon Albarn later stated maybe \"End of a Century\", wasn't the proper choice for the fourth single. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Blur/_/End+of+a+Century\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

Basically, it's one 18-minute song that pretty much encapsulates everything NOFX is known for, commenting on the state of the USA in a political and religious sense. Topics it muses on during its concourse includes gun control, widespread apathy and conditioning, condemning the religious right-wing and anything that ties in with the underlying theme of the country's decline.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/NOFX/_/The+Decline\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

  "wiki_summary": "\"Swing Life Away\" is a vast departure from the aggressive punk-round sound that Rise Against is known for. A softer, acoustic song, it captures the emotions of coming to terms with the joy that can be found in a mediocre life, while staying optimistic about the future. It talks about life on minimum wage or not getting paid at all. It is one of Rise Against’s acoustic punk ballads where the singer explains that a dedicated, passionate relationship is far more important than money. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rise+Against/_/Swing+Life+Away\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

  "wiki_summary": "\"Where Is My Mind?\" is a song by the American alternative rock band Pixies. It is the seventh track on their 1988 album Surfer Rosa. The song was written by frontman Black Francis while he attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst, inspired by his experiences scuba diving in the Caribbean. He later said he had \"this very small fish trying to chase me. I don't know why - I don't know too much about fish behavior.\"\nIt is one of the band's signature songs and has inspired a multitude of covers. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pixies/_/Where+Is+My+Mind%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

The song was recorded on 4-track cassette at Joanna Bolme’s apartment, on SE 34th Ave. at Hawthorne Blvd. in Portland. Due to the quiet recording, and the sonic limitations of 4-track cassette, the song has a unique sound that gives the track a haunting vibe. The song’s ambiguous tonality has been analyzed in-depth by the Society for Music Theory. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elliott+Smith/_/Speed+Trials\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

She described it as a song about a relationship with a man who she could feel was “slowly slipping away.”\n\nIt’s about watching somebody fade away in a relationship. They said they were going to be with you forever, that they loved you, and then something changed in the relationship and you don’t know what it is, but you’re watching them slowly drift. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Forever+&+Always\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

Taylor Swift highlights the idea of karma as a personified boyfriend, saying it is a god, a breeze in her hair, a cat that purrs in her lap and an acrobat that keeps her company. The last verse points out that although it can be hard to learn lessons sometimes, these lessons will help in the long run and shows how Taylor has remained strong and resilient despite all the challenges she has faced. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Karma\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

It is also available on their third album There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The song is particularly unique among the band's work because of Dave Grohl's implementation of the talk box in parts of the song. The usage of the device was partly inspired by Grohl's admiration of Peter Frampton and Joe Walsh, both of whom helped popularise it in the 1970s. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Generator\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

  "wiki_summary": "\"Times Like These\" is the second single released from the Foo Fighters' fourth album One by One. It was released on two main discs in 2003. It is in 4/4 time but includes 7/4 irregular time signature timing in the main riff. The chorus of the song is also grouped in bars of 3 rather than the regular bars of 4. The song is sometimes listed by its full original title, \"Times Like These (One-Way Motorway).\" The lyric \"I'm a new day rising\" is a reference to the album New Day Rising by Hüsker Dü, one of Dave Grohl's favorite groups. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Times+Like+These\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

It was released as a single in August 1987, reaching #13 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIt was the first of three singles from the band's last studio album Strangeways, Here We Come. As such, it was the last single to include newly recorded material on the b-side. It holds the distinction of containing the last recorded Smiths song, I Keep Mine Hidden. Also included – and recorded at the same session – was a cover version of a Cilla Black song, Work Is a Four-Letter Word. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/_/Girlfriend+in+a+Coma\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

  "wiki_summary": "\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\" is about the frustrating experience of being in an unhappy, disconnected relationship. The singer reflects on his past life when he was \"happy in the haze of a drunken hour\", and then contrasts it with his miserable present reality. The song criticizes the other person in the relationship, recognizing they don't care if the singer \"lives or dies\", and bemoaning their emotional detachment. The singer questions why he even bothers to put effort into the relationship, when it's clear the other person doesn't care. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/_/Heaven+Knows+I%27m+Miserable+Now\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

The song was first recorded as a demo towards the end of 1996, then entitled \"Crazy Days\". Matthew Bellamy's own paraphrased recollections have him moving from Teignmouth to Exeter when he was 18, which he became in July of the same year. Thus, we can deduce that the song was composed sometime during the latter half of 1996. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Muse/_/Yes+Please\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

  "wiki_summary": "“Long Line of Cars” by Cake, from their 2001 album Comfort Eagle, blends the band's signature ironic lyrics with a steady, driving rhythm. On the surface, it narrates a literal traffic jam, but beneath lies a metaphor for societal conformity and the monotony of modern life. The song critiques how individuals often follow routines without questioning their purpose, highlighting themes of consumerism and environmental concerns. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cake/_/Long+Line+Of+Cars\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

  "wiki_summary": "\"You Know What You Are?\" is the second track from 2005's With Teeth. Its title strongly resembles \"You Know Who You Are.\"\n\nBeginning immediately with Dave Grohl's quick drumming, the song is differentiated as the only studio NIN song featuring prominent double bass technique. Joined by panning noise loops, a distorted guitar riff and echoing synthesizers, Trent Reznor delivers each verse in yells, a delay effect bouncing his voice throughout the mix. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails/_/You+Know+What+You+Are%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

Lovecraft,  with Cthulhu being the focus of the song and documenting his control over his followers. The song also  takes lyrical inspiration from lines in Lovecraft's book Necronomicon. Musically the song is a marked contrast from the rest of the songs on the album, being slower and having a subdued intensity. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/The+Thing+That+Should+Not+Be\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

It shares part of its name with Orinoco Studios (now Miloco Studios), where it was recorded.\n\nThe division of syllables to follow the pattern of music may trick the listener into thinking that the song is written in Latin (as some Enya tracks are), but the lyrics are in fact English. At the end of the song she pays tribute to Warner Brothers Music UK CEO Rob Dickins and makes a more veiled reference to producer Ross Cullum. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Enya/_/Orinoco+Flow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

The song charted on both Billboard rock charts, despite the fact that it was not released as a single and no video was filmed for it. It was played heavily in the acoustic sets of Alice in Chains' 2006 reunion tour. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Alice+in+Chains/_/Over+Now\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

Like many other Dylan songs of the 1965-66 period, \"Maggie's Farm\" is based in electric blues.\n\nThe song, essentially a protest song against protest folk, represents Dylan's transition from a folk singer who sought authenticity in traditional song-forms and activist politics to an innovative stylist whose self-exploration made him a cultural muse for a generation. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/Maggie%27s+Farm\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

Recorded in September 1974, it appeared as the fifth track on Dylan's album Blood on the Tracks, released in January 1975.\n\nThe song's lyrics have brought forth multiple interpretations—from the idea that they are confessional, to Dylan's claims that the album was inspired by literature, to the lyrics being called Dylan's most masterfully written love poem. Many believe the song describes Dylan's relationship issues with his wife during the time when they were separated. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/You%27re+Gonna+Make+Me+Lonesome+When+You+Go\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

As with many of the major songs Dylan composed at this time, he often adapted or \"borrowed\" melodies from traditional songs. On this occasion however, he had borrowed an arrangement by veteran folksinger Jean Ritchie. The arrangement of \"Nottanum Town\", unknown to Dylan, had been in her family for generations, and Ritchie wanted an acknowledgement on the writing credit. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/Masters+of+War\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

It was first recorded by rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival (in which Fogerty played lead guitar and sang lead vocals) on the 1969 album Bayou Country. According to the Proud Mary Songfacts, the phrase \"Proud Mary\" reminded John Fogerty of a domestic washerwoman, which is what he started writing the song about. When he wrote the music, the first few chords reminded him of a paddle-wheel going around, and he thought of the Mississippi River. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Creedence+Clearwater+Revival/_/Proud+Mary\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

Guitar pedals and effects are used to distort the sound of Adrian Young's drums.  As for the guitar, Dumont's performance has been stated as greatly influenced by Devo, further contributing to the track's new wave feel. \nThe song was the first song to be recorded by No Doubt as a four-piece after original keyboardist Eric Stefani's departure in 1994 before promotion for Tragic Kingdom began. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/No+Doubt/_/New\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

  "wiki_summary": "\"Spiderwebs\" is a ska punk song written by Gwen Stefani and Tony Kanal for No Doubt's third studio album Tragic Kingdom. It was released as the album's second single in 1995. When \"Spiderwebs\" reached the radio airwaves in the U.S, it began a revival of the ska genre. The song is a combination of ska and pop. With its ubiquitous airplay for months, more ska-flavored singles became prevalent in later years such as The Mighty Mighty Bosstones' \"The Impression That I Get\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/No+Doubt/_/Spiderwebs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

A mostly romantic song, it is one of the softest Rammstein songs up to now, maybe because it was written during a period when all members but one were experiencing relationship problems.\n\nStory\n\nThe music video features Richard, Ollie, Doom and Paul pushing a boat in the sand. In the boat stand a masked Flake and Till singing. At one point they keelhaul Till, and the boat bursts in flames. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rammstein/_/Seemann\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

Several of these recordings were posted to weezer.com, but \"December\" was not among them. The song was attempted again for the Radio 1 show The Evening Session, presented by Steve Lamacq, on June 13, 2001. Normally, bands record four songs to promote a new album, but Weezer performed eight entirely new songs. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Weezer/_/December\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

It was officially released in 2002, though it had been performed live and in the studio during the band's 2000 summer tour comeback after hiatus.\n\n\"Dope Nose\" was said to have been written on the same night as the hit song \"Hash Pipe\" from The Green Album, although Rivers' Catalog of Riffs suggests otherwise. A common belief is that frontman Rivers Cuomo had three shots of tequila and Ritalin moments before writing both songs. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Weezer/_/Dope+Nose\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

It is slow in tempo and features prominent use of drop D guitar playing (which became the norm for Chris Cornell's compositions, particularly on the future 1991 album Badmotorfinger) and exhibits Cornell's vocal range well. Its sinister mood can possibly be linked to the placement on the album - it is between the songs 665 and 667. Rhymically, it is unusual for Soundgarden as Matt Cameron plays a more tribal style of drumming. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Soundgarden/_/Beyond+the+Wheel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

  "wiki_summary": "\"The Gentle Art of Making Enemies\" is a song by Faith No More from their classic album \"King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime\".\n\n\"The Gentle Art of Making Enemies\" is one of the heaviest songs on the album. The song's title comes from James McNeill Whistler's 1890 book The Gentle Art of Making Enemies. A single for the song had been planned but was cancelled due to poor record sales. However, the song later appeared on Faith No More's 1998 greatest hits compilation Who Cares a Lot?. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Faith+No+More/_/The+Gentle+Art+of+Making+Enemies\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

Both parts are performed by actress Kate Moran in a very similar style, making it unclear if it’s intended to be two people, or one experiencing dissociative identity disorder.

None of these questions are answered. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/M83/_/Car+Chase+Terror+%21\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
